This is a Python script as seen on https://forum.biobakery.org/t/merge-metaphlan-tables-py-with-absolute-abundance/1839 for the concatenation of absolute clade marker gene counts tables.

Ideally, set it up in the biobakery conda environment `~/miniconda3/envs/biobakery3/bin/merge_metaphlan_tables_abs.py` and add execution permissions `chmod +x merge_metaphlan_tables_abs.py`.
